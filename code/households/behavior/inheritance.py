"""Determines how property is transmitted and where heirs live.

This module models defines the events that occur when a Person dies. While 
different types of InheritanceRules can be defined, most will use a combination
of functions (defined here and custom) to determine whether there is property 
that can be inherited, determine the heirs of that property, and enact any 
required residency changes.

The foundational InheritanceRule accomplishes this through three functions,
while the more advanced InheritanceRuleComplex accomplishes this with five.
The customizability of the latter is useful for articulating exactly how
Houses should be transmitted and occupied. 

A planned expansion is to have inheritance rules closely tied to (and likely 
containing) the AgeTable for dying, such that populations with different
mortality rates can be associated easily with different inheritance regimes.

    """Define inheritance of property after death.
    
    Inheritance is carried out upon the death of an individual by that
    individual. Thus an InheritanceRule as a callable can only take one argument,
    the person who died. In doing so, it will call three other functions:
        1. has_property, to determine whether the individual has transmissable
            property;
        2. rule, which both carries out the property transmission and moves the
            ownership of the property as well as any people;
        3. failure, which is called only if an heir cannot be found or an 
            inheritance cannot be negotiated (or fails for other reasons.)
    
    Complications do not need to use this tripartite structure, but must be defined
    as subclasses in order to be recognized by the simulation as an inheritance
    rule.

    ----------
    has_property : callable

    rule : callable
        A function that takes 1 argument (a person) and determines
        how property will be inherited, and moves the property. It must return
        a bool of whether inheritance happened. The most generic form of an 
        InheritanceRule.
