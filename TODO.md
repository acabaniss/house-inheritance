----------

- Classes need to be defined that create a unified class for inheritance, locality, and fragmentation rules.
- Once developed, a similar set of rules need to be created for remarriage, incest prohibitions.
- Birth rules need to allow uneven sex ratios.
- Value checks need to make sure that agetables and different rules are used where they need to be.
- Matrilineal inheritance.
- Houses need to be able to be variable, expanded, etc.
	- A build function for houses that creates an owner and moves in a family
	- An expansion function that increases the size of the house.
