----------

This project is an ABM (agent-based model) for examining household inheritance and demography in the ancient Mediterranean. Individuals residing within houses are modeled to explore the effects of birth and death rates alongside marriage locality, household fragmentation, and inheritance rules on houses and households. The goal is to eventually provide an easily-adaptable model to control for demographic processes in the analysis of household assemblages and characteristics.

This project is written in python 2. While originally constructed for Prof. Lynette Shaw's graduate course on computational modeling, I am now adapting it for more general use.
