"""Create human legible descriptions of Persons, Houses, and Diaries.

This module provides functionality for summarizing Person and House instances
that make them easier to read for a user of the households package. This is to
make qualitative exploration of a simulation easier, and frankly helps in
debugging in order to guarantee that the simulation reflects the social 
phenomena modeled.

Narrative also defines the Diary instance, which is used to keep track of 
events in each Person's life. It also defines the name base and address base
used for the simulation, which should be modified if desired before generating 
the founder's population.

Notes
-----
This will eventually be extended to include Community and and World objects.
