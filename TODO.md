# To-do list for feature development, addition, and expansion #

----------

**Short-term**

- Classes need to be defined that create a unified class for inheritance, locality, and fragmentation rules.
- Birth rules need to allow uneven sex ratios.
- Value checks need to make sure that agetables and different rules are used where they need to be.
- Add Du and Kamakura 2006 as well as other household type definitions to the residency module.
	- Expand the module to become a subpackage with different definitions.


**Medium-term**

- Once developed, a set of classes and rules need to be created for remarriage, incest prohibitions, divorce.
	- Allow divorce and different causes thereof, as well as different settlement options.
- Matrilineal inheritance.
- Houses need to be able to be variable, expanded, etc.
	- A build function for houses that creates an owner and moves in a family
	- An expansion function that increases the size of the house.
- Non-kin and enslaved/otherwise dependent residents.
	- Also renters/lodgers
- Add household classification options for non-coresidential families, e.g. worker migration.

**Long-term**

- Multiple/partitive ownership of buildings? Ownership vs. residency problem.
	- Also ownership of multiple buildings.
- Allow polygamy, and consequently allow alternative definition of a "nuclear" family and what this means for fragmentation.
