"""A demographic agent-based model of individuals and households

This module implements an object-oriented, agent-based model of how individuals
live and die with empirical life tables and birth rates. It was originally
designed for historical and archaeological modelling, but can be used in a
variety of contexts. Demographic data are based on Bagnall and Frier for
Roman Egypt, and as a result this asusmes a Coale and Demeny style life
table for empirical demography (fertility schedules, marriage eligibility,
and death rates.)

The container for a given simulation is the World, which needs to be set up to contain at least
one Community. The World also provides some pass-through access to the People contained in all
Communities, as well as all Diaries (which record the events of individual lives) via a library.
The World is where each year progresses for all people, resulting in deaths, marriages, moves, 
and births throughout all Communities.

Each Community is started with a given number of Persons and Houses, as well as core 
characteristics for the people (i.e. what their behaviors should be.) Communities are currently
homogeneous to start with, but can become heterogeneous in behavior by migration (mobility) 
between different villages. The planned founders module will enable more heterogeneous starting 
configurations. 

Persons are individual agents with an assigned sex who age and have the option to undergo major 
life events once each year, and in the process develop kinship networks (as well as growing up
within them). Schedules like mortality and fertility schedules are stored in AgeTables.
Persons can be related via birth or marriage as well as through residency in Houses,
and these different types of relationships are explored through the kinship and residency 
modules. Houses are environmental and can only be affected by Persons. Persons (and eventually
Houses) have their histories recorded in Diaries (defined in narrative).
